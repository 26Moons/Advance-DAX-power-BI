Row Context vs Filter Context (Power BI / DAX)

Think: Row = “current row” | Filter = “filtered view”

1. Row Context (What it is)

Row context happens when DAX evaluates a calculation row by row.

It exists automatically when:

You write a calculated column

You iterate using X functions (e.g., SUMX, FILTER, AVERAGEX)

Row Context = The DAX engine knows which row it is currently on.

Row Context Example Table
Student	Candies
Jack	5
Ria	2
Chris	10
Calculated Column Example (Row Context)
Candies * 2


Internally DAX thinks like this:

For Jack → 5 * 2 = 10

For Ria → 2 * 2 = 4

For Chris → 10 * 2 = 20

Each row "knows" its own value.

DAX Explicit Row Context Example
TotalTimesTwo = SUMX( Students, Students[Candies] * 2 )


This also loops row by row:

Take Jack: (5 * 2)

Take Ria: (2 * 2)

Take Chris: (10 * 2)
Then sum everything.

Row Context Key Points

Exists on calculated columns

Exists in iterators (SUMX, AVERAGEX, FILTER)

Automatically row-by-row

Does not apply filters by itself

2. Filter Context (What it is)

Filter context is what slices of data are currently visible due to:

Visual filters

Page filters

Report filters

Slicers

DAX filters (ex: CALCULATE)

Filter Context = What portion of the data is included?

Filter Context Example Visual

If you put SUM(Candies) in a card visual → you get:

5 + 2 + 10 = 17


If you apply a filter = Student = “Jack”

Only Jack is visible → 5


If a slicer chooses Candies > 4:

Jack (5)

Chris (10)

So SUM(Candies) becomes:

5 + 10 = 15

Filter Context Example in DAX
Total Candies = SUM( Students[Candies] )

Total Red Products =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Units]),
    Sales[Color] = "Red"
)


CALCULATE changes the filter on the data.

Filter Context Key Points

Comes from:

Visuals

Slicers

Filters

DAX functions

Applies before formula logic

Can be overridden or modified using CALCULATE

Simple Analogy
Row Context	Filter Context
Like reading row-by-row in a spreadsheet	Like filtering a spreadsheet to only show some rows
“For this Row…”	“Only these rows count…”
Exists in Calculated Columns	Exists in Measures
SUMX loops row by row	CALCULATE changes filters
No filter change	Can change what's included
Power BI Practical Example
Row Context

Calculated Column:

Sales[Profit] = Sales[Revenue] - Sales[Cost]


→ Works per row.
No need to filter data.

Filter Context

Measure:

Total Red Units =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Units]),
    Sales[Color] = "Red"
)


→ Slices the data to include only red products.

MOST IMPORTANT RULE

Row context does not automatically apply filters.
To convert row context → filter context, we use:

CALCULATE()

Final Summary (Copy-Paste)

Row Context = Current Row → Exists in Calculated Columns & Iterators (SUMX, FILTER).

Filter Context = Current Filtered Data → Comes from Visuals, Slicers, Filters, CALCULATE.

Row context is about looping rows.

Filter context is about what data is included or excluded.

Row context does not filter.

Use CALCULATE to turn row context into filter context.
